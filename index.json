Differential privacy provides a formal guarantee that individual-level information about users does not leak. In this framework, randomized algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data, resulting in privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only the privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to perform valid inferences on parameters underlying the confidential data. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. Specifically, we use neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and on ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms.","tags":[],"title":"Conditional Density Estimations from Privacy-Protected Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691443800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691443800,"objectID":"102a71d8b7036215242d84785e4077fd","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/snp-slice-jsm23/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:01:18-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snp-slice-jsm23/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":" SNP-Slice: A Bayesian nonparametric framework to resolve SNP haplotypes in mixed infections ","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nianqiao Ju","Jiawei Liu","Qixin He"],"categories":["evolutionary biology"],"content":"","date":1690675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690675200,"objectID":"6acde560cc9c04d1b94812da46df37ed","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/publication/snpslice/","publishdate":"2023-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snpslice/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-strain infection is a common yet under-investigated phenomenon of many pathogens. Currently,biologists analyzing SNP information have to discard mixed infection samples,because existing downstream analyses require monogenomic infection inputs.Such a protocol impedes our understanding of the real genetic diversity, co-infection patterns,and genomic relatedness of pathogens.A reliable tool to learn and resolve the SNP haplotypes from polygenomic data is an urgent need in molecular epidemiology.In this work,we develop a slice sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm,named SNP-Slice,to learn not only the SNP haplotypes of all strains in the populations but also which strains infect each host. Our method reconstructs SNP haplotypes and allele frequencies accurately without reference panels and outperforms the state of art methods at estimating the multiplicity of infections,allele frequencies,and heterozygosity. We illustrate the performance ofS NP-Slice on empirical malaria and HIV datasets.","tags":[],"title":"SNP-Slice: A Bayesian nonparametric framework to resolve SNP haplotypes in mixed infections","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689606050,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689606050,"objectID":"e8f9e6c5a421b6eb1d032a46339c2c1b","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/mcmcdp1-cas23/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mcmcdp1-cas23/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC for Bayesian Inference from Privatized Data ","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686677400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686677400,"objectID":"6f4ea3a239b15aeb99ecdcd7d108335a","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/snp-slice-icsa23/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snp-slice-icsa23/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SNP-Slice: A Bayesian nonparametric framework to resolve SNP haplotypes in mixed infections","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684566000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684566000,"objectID":"dc2287a1049e933c22a37868fcde5c6e","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/mcmcdp1-umn/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mcmcdp1-umn/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC for Bayesian Inference from Privatized Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683356400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683356400,"objectID":"e0cded9309cd549be04eac3f9ce0c56f","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/mcmcdp1-bff8/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mcmcdp1-bff8/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC for Bayesian Inference from Privatized Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nianqiao Ju","Jordan A.

Restricting access to only the privatized data makes it challenging to perform valid statistical inference on parameters underlying the confidential data. Specifically, the likelihood function of the privatized data requires integrating over the large space of confidential databases and is typically intractable. For Bayesian analysis, this results in a posterior distribution that is doubly intractable, rendering traditional MCMC techniques inapplicable. We propose an MCMC framework to perform Bayesian inference from the privatized data, which is applicable to a wide range of statistical models and privacy mechanisms. Our MCMC algorithm augments the model parameters with the unobserved confidential data, and alternately updates each one conditional on the other. For the potentially challenging step of updating the confidential data, we propose a generic approach that exploits the privacy guarantee of the mechanism to ensure efficiency. In particular, we give results on the computational complexity, acceptance rate, and mixing properties of our MCMC. We illustrate the efficacy and applicability of our methods on a naïve-Bayes log-linear model as well as on a linear regression model.","tags":[],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC for Bayesian Inference from Privatized Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616064044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616064044,"objectID":"a65b1557978752c77c14226fbfbc88f8","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/wellesley-colloqium-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T12:50:44-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wellesley-colloqium-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bernoulli, sum of Bernoullis and Markov chain","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614326425,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614326425,"objectID":"c528a5c7b097184daf8d2d76f443cde5","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/warwick-seminar-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T12:50:25-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/warwick-seminar-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613095200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613095200,"objectID":"6cf06cd2ffc2bed1932a247b62c5a57d","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/purdue-seminar/","publishdate":"2021-02-11T21:21:55-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/purdue-seminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nianqiao Ju","Jeremy Heng","Pierre E.
