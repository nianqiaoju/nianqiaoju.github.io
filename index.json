The distribution of the vector conditional on its sum is known as the conditional Bernoulli distribution. Assuming that $N$ goes to infinity and that the sum is proportional to N, exact sampling costs order $N^2$, while a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm using 'swaps' has constant cost per iteration. We provide conditions under which this Markov chain converges in order $N\\log N$ iterations. Our proof relies on couplings and an auxiliary Markov chain defined on a partition of the space into favorable and unfavorable pairs.","tags":[],"title":"A simple Markov chain for independent Bernoulli variables conditioned on their sum","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602203400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602203400,"objectID":"1d5fd20df5768f2b476e39047cf15186","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/condbern/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T15:55:22-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/condbern/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"MCMC for independent Bernoullis conditioning on their sum","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Qingyuan Zhao","Nianqiao Ju","Sergio Bacallado","Rajen D.
