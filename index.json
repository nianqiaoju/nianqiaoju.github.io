These permutation-invariant joint distributions often have dependency structures that make sampling challenging. Component-wise sampling strategies, such as Metropolis-within-Gibbs, can mix slowly because they consider only comparing a proposed point with one component at a time. In this work, we propose a novel Single-Offer-Multiple-Attempts (SOMA) sampler that is tailored to sampling permutation invariant distributions. The core intuition of SOMA is that a proposed point unsuitable to replace one component might still be a good candidate to replace some other component in the joint distribution. SOMA first makes a singer offer, and then simultaneously considers attempts to replace each component of the current state with the single offer, before making the final acceptance or rejection decision. We provide an acceptance lower bound of SOMA and, using a coupling method, derive the convergence rate upper bound of SOMA in the two-dimensional case. We validate theoretical findings with numerical simulations, including a demonstration on differentially private Bayesian linear regression.","tags":["Gibbs sampler","MCMC","data augmentation"],"title":"SOMA: a novel sampler for exchangeable variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yifei Xiong","Nianqiao Ju","Sanguo Zhang"],"categories":["differential privacy","simulation-based inference"],"content":"","date":1743206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743206400,"objectID":"13a4ef914b24100a37c8071207e4ef32","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/publication/neuraldensity/","publishdate":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neuraldensity/","section":"publication","summary":"Many modern statistical analysis and machine learning applications require training models on sensitive user data. Differential privacy provides a formal guarantee that individual-level information about users does not leak. In this framework, randomized algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data, resulting in privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only the privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to perform valid inferences on parameters underlying the confidential data. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. Specifically, we use neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and on ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms.","tags":["differential privacy"],"title":"Simulation-based Bayesian inference from privacy-protected data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qian Qin","Nianqiao Ju","Guanyang Wang"],"categories":["MCMC"],"content":"","date":1742428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742428800,"objectID":"55f3bc4f07b1bee77e68c0df7fb075cc","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/publication/hybridgibbs/","publishdate":"2023-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hybridgibbs/","section":"publication","summary":"Hybrid Gibbs samplers represent a prominent class of approximated Gibbs algorithms that utilize Markov chains to approximate conditional distributions, with the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm standing out as a well-known example. Despite their widespread use in both statistical and non-statistical applications, very little is known about their convergence properties. This article introduces novel methods for establishing bounds on the convergence rates of hybrid Gibbs samplers. In particular, we examine the convergence characteristics of hybrid random-scan Gibbs and data augmentation algorithms. Our analysis reveals that the absolute spectral gap of a reversible hybrid chain can be bounded based on the absolute spectral gap of the exact Gibbs chain and the absolute spectral gaps of the Markov chains employed for conditional distribution approximations. The new techniques are applied to four algorithms: a random-scan Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, a hybrid proximal sampler, random-scan Gibbs samplers with block updates, and a hybrid slice sampler.","tags":["Gibbs sampler","MCMC"],"title":"Spectral gap bounds for reversible hybrid Gibbs chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"ee06cb6d5cb018bde9ddc011ad44bcc1","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/mcmcda-2025/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/mcmcda-2025/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["mcmc","highlight"],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC: connections to privacy and advances in convergence analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"063c915c465aa1e1a2b73ff9acccc671","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/2025soma/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T08:03:50-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2025soma/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["mcmc"],"title":"SOMA: a novel sampler for exchangeable variables","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nianqiao Ju","Jiawei Liu","Qixin He"],"categories":["computational biology"],"content":"","date":1718323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718323200,"objectID":"6acde560cc9c04d1b94812da46df37ed","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/publication/snpslice/","publishdate":"2023-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/snpslice/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-strain infection is a common yet under-investigated phenomenon of many pathogens. Currently,biologists analyzing SNP information have to discard mixed infection samples,because existing downstream analyses require monogenomic infection inputs.Such a protocol impedes our understanding of the real genetic diversity, co-infection patterns,and genomic relatedness of pathogens.A reliable tool to learn and resolve the SNP haplotypes from polygenomic data is an urgent need in molecular epidemiology.In this work,we develop a slice sampling Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm,named SNP-Slice,to learn not only the SNP haplotypes of all strains in the populations but also which strains infect each host. Our method reconstructs SNP haplotypes and allele frequencies accurately without reference panels and outperforms the state of art methods at estimating the multiplicity of infections,allele frequencies,and heterozygosity. We illustrate the performance ofS NP-Slice on empirical malaria and HIV datasets.","tags":["computational biology","MCMC","Bayesian inference","Gibbs sampler"],"title":"SNP-Slice: A Bayesian nonparametric framework to resolve SNP haplotypes in mixed infections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jordan A.

We show that the distance between the sampling distributions under unbounded DP and bounded DP goes to zero as the sample size $n$ goes to infinity, provided that the noise used to privatize n is at an appropriate rate; we also establish that ABC-type posterior distributions converge under similar assumptions. We further give asymptotic results in the regime where the privacy budget for n goes to zero, establishing similarity of sampling distributions as well as showing that the MLE in the unbounded setting converges to the bounded-DP MLE. In order to facilitate valid, finite-sample Bayesian inference on privatized data in the unbounded DP setting, we propose a reversible jump MCMC algorithm which extends the data augmentation MCMC of Ju et al. (2022). We also propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to compute the MLE from privatized data in both bounded and unbounded DP.

Restricting access to only the privatized data makes it challenging to perform valid statistical inference on parameters underlying the confidential data. Specifically, the likelihood function of the privatized data requires integrating over the large space of confidential databases and is typically intractable. For Bayesian analysis, this results in a posterior distribution that is doubly intractable, rendering traditional MCMC techniques inapplicable. We propose an MCMC framework to perform Bayesian inference from the privatized data, which is applicable to a wide range of statistical models and privacy mechanisms. Our MCMC algorithm augments the model parameters with the unobserved confidential data, and alternately updates each one conditional on the other. For the potentially challenging step of updating the confidential data, we propose a generic approach that exploits the privacy guarantee of the mechanism to ensure efficiency. In particular, we give results on the computational complexity, acceptance rate, and mixing properties of our MCMC. We illustrate the efficacy and applicability of our methods on a naïve-Bayes log-linear model as well as on a linear regression model.","tags":["mcmc"],"title":"Data Augmentation MCMC for Bayesian Inference from Privatized Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616064044,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616064044,"objectID":"a65b1557978752c77c14226fbfbc88f8","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/wellesley-colloqium-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T12:50:44-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/wellesley-colloqium-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bernoulli, sum of Bernoullis and Markov chain","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614326425,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614326425,"objectID":"c528a5c7b097184daf8d2d76f443cde5","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/warwick-seminar-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T12:50:25-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/warwick-seminar-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613095200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613095200,"objectID":"6cf06cd2ffc2bed1932a247b62c5a57d","permalink":"https://nianqiaoju.github.io/talk/purdue-seminar/","publishdate":"2021-02-11T21:21:55-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/purdue-seminar/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms for agent-based models of disease transmission","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nianqiao Ju","Jeremy Heng","Pierre E.
